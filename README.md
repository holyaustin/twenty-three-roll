## Description

This project was made using several technologies. The front-end was designed using a server-side-rendering javascript tech known as NextJS. the latest version of Next was used because of how fast it was to build the project.

The smart contracts was done for the game token using XRC-20 template while the core Game enfine was written all in solidity language,. compile and deployed with Hardhat. ethers.js was used to interact with the smart contract. The contract was deployed to  blockchain. The entire project demo was hosted to Vercel.
